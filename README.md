Cloud computing is essential for modern data storage and sharing, offering flexibility, scalability, and cost- effectiveness. However, it faces challenges related to secure data management.
The framework employs Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) for robust encryption, generating dynamic keys for each session or file to enhance security.
A lightweight blockchain system is used to securely store and manage encryption keys, ensuring decentralization, immutability, and tamper-proof access control.
Unlike traditional email-based key sharing, the blockchain offers a transparent, decentralized solution to reduce reliance on centralized entities and mitigate security risks.
Encrypted files are uploaded to Google Drive with unique file IDs for sharing. Decryption keys are retrieved securely from the blockchain for access.
The framework, developed in Python, integrates AES encryption and blockchain technology, providing a scalable, efficient, and privacy-preserving solution for secure cloud storage and data management.
